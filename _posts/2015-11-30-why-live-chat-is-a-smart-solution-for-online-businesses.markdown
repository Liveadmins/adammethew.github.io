The digital era has redefined the way business is done and companies are increasingly engaging with customers via online channels. It is important for e-shops to interact with clients in a meaningful manner because consumers feel valued when businesses make an effort to connect with them. As a result, they become loyal customers and online companies benefit from repeat business. This can be achieved by using live chat, an interactive communication channel which plays an important role in the long-term success of an e-commerce website. 

<h3>Provide Real-Time Customer Support</h3> 

Customers may visit your website with queries, suggestions and requests during your off hours. It is your duty to make sure that someone is always there to answer all their questions and cater to their needs so that they are not left waiting and unattended. By providing them with a  <b><a href="http://www.liveadmins.com/blog/3-tips-for-optimizing-live-chat-experience-for-your-customers/">timely response through live chat service</a></b> , your company saves them the time and trouble of having to call and email you especially if they have urgent matters that need to be taken care of. 

Thus, by ensuring that your staff is available 24/7 to provide immediate assistance whenever required, your business provides convenience to clients and overcomes potential barriers of communication which they may face when attempting to contact you.

<h3>Increase Sales</h3>

Customers only do business with brands they trust. Hence, it is important for your company to build rapport with clients so that they always purchase your goods and services. Use live chat to give them information and advice on your best buys and deals. Live chat service always comes in handy especially when your online business looks to convince potential customers that they are making the right choice by choosing your company over the competition. 

Live chat also enables you to immediately answer their queries and solve any concerns that may influence their buying decisions. Additionally, live chat operators can efficiently and effectively clear any confusion that clients might have in completing the sales process on your website. It reduces the risk of cart abandonment and results in higher sales.

<h3>Develop Long-Term Customer Relationships</h3>

Building a strong customer-brand relationship based on trust is crucial for the success of every business. Invite customers to learn more about your company and what you offer by chatting with actual people on your website. This makes customers realize that your business is always accessible to them and chances are that they will spread positive word about your company. Live chat is an effective communication tool which helps build a stronger relationship between customers and the company. You can also benefit tremendously by gathering  <b><a href="http://blogs.rediff.com/adammethew/2015/01/20/effective-techniques-of-collecting-customer-feedback/">customer feedback via live chat</a></b> .
